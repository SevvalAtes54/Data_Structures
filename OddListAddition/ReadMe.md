# ODDNUMBER

Lab2Datastr is a C program that allows the user to input a series of numbers. The program then segregates these numbers into two separate linked lists, one for even numbers and another for odd numbers. It provides two options for inserting numbers: adding even numbers to the end of the even list and adding odd numbers to the beginning of the odd list.

## Features

- Allows the user to input a series of numbers.
- Separates even and odd numbers into two linked lists.
- Supports adding even numbers to the end of the even list.
- Supports adding odd numbers to the beginning of the odd list.
- Gracefully handles unexpected input (e.g., non-integer input).

## How to Use

1. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
